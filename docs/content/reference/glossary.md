# Glossary

**Last Updated:** January 2026

Comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout TAG IT Network documentation.

---

## A

### AIRP (AI Recovery Protocol)
The automated system for handling lost, stolen, or disputed assets. AIRP combines on-chain flagging, quarantine periods, multi-party arbitration, and AI-assisted evidence evaluation to resolve ownership disputes.

### Asset
A physical product that has been registered in the TAG IT Network. Each asset has a corresponding Digital Twin (NFT) on the blockchain.

### Activate
The lifecycle function that marks an asset as QA-verified and ready for retail sale. Transitions state from BOUND → ACTIVATED.

---

## B

### BIDGES (Badge Identity & Delegation for Gated Execution System)
TAG IT's two-token access control system combining soulbound Identity Badges (who you are) with transferable Capability Badges (what you can do).

### Bind
The lifecycle function that cryptographically links a physical NFC tag to its Digital Twin. Transitions state from MINTED → BOUND.

### Burn Floor
The immutable minimum burn rate (3.33%) that cannot be changed by governance. Ensures some portion of protocol fees are always burned.

---

## C

### Capability Badge
An ERC-1155 token granting permission to execute specific functions (mint, bind, activate, etc.). Unlike Identity Badges, Capability Badges can be transferred or delegated.

### CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)
Chainlink's protocol for secure cross-chain messaging. TAG IT uses CCIP to bridge assets and messages between chains.

### Claim
The lifecycle function that transfers ownership to a consumer at point of sale. Transitions state from ACTIVATED → CLAIMED.

### CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code)
A cryptographic signature generated by NFC chips (like NTAG 424 DNA) to prove the physical tag was scanned.

---

## D

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
TAG IT's governance structure where stakeholders vote on protocol changes. Uses a multi-house voting system with weighted representation.

### Digital Twin
The NFT representation of a physical product on the blockchain. Contains metadata, ownership history, and lifecycle state.

---

## E

### EigenDA
The data availability layer used by TAG IT L2 for posting transaction data. Part of the EigenLayer restaking ecosystem.

### ERC-721
The Ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). TAG IT's Digital Twins are ERC-721 tokens with extensions.

### ERC-1155
The Ethereum standard for multi-token contracts. Used for Capability Badges where users can hold multiple of the same capability.

### ERC-5192
The Ethereum standard for soulbound tokens. Used for Identity Badges that cannot be transferred.

---

## F

### Flag
The lifecycle function that marks an asset as lost, stolen, or recalled. Transitions state from CLAIMED → FLAGGED.

### FIPS 140-3
Federal Information Processing Standard for cryptographic modules. Required for U.S. government and defense applications.

---

## G

### Genesis Supply
The initial token supply at launch: 7,777,777,333 TAGIT (the "Magic Number").

---

## H

### House (Governance)
One of five stakeholder groups in TAG IT's multi-house DAO: Gov/Military, Enterprise, Public, Developer, Regulatory.

---

## I

### Identity Badge
A soulbound (non-transferable) ERC-5192 token representing verified identity level (KYC_L1, KYC_L2, MANUFACTURER, etc.).

---

## K

### KYC (Know Your Customer)
Identity verification levels required for different operations. L1 = basic, L2 = enhanced, L3 = institutional.

---

## L

### Lifecycle
The deterministic state machine governing asset progression: NONE → MINTED → BOUND → ACTIVATED → CLAIMED → FLAGGED → RECYCLED.

### L2 (Layer 2)
A scaling solution built on top of Ethereum. TAG IT L2 uses the OP Stack for high-throughput, low-cost transactions.

---

## M

### Mint
The lifecycle function that creates a new Digital Twin NFT. Transitions state from NONE → MINTED.

### Multi-House Voting
TAG IT's governance model where votes are weighted by stakeholder house membership rather than pure token holdings.

---

## N

### NFC (Near Field Communication)
Short-range wireless technology used for tag authentication. TAG IT primarily uses NTAG 424 DNA chips.

### NTAG 424 DNA
NXP's secure NFC chip with AES-128 encryption and SUN authentication. TAG IT's primary chip for CLASS 2/3 applications.

---

## O

### OP Stack
Optimism's modular rollup framework. TAG IT L2 is built on OP Stack with EigenDA for data availability.

### ORACULS (Open Registry for Authentic Custody & Universal Ledger System)
TAG IT Network's complete technology stack including apps, services, smart contracts, and infrastructure.

### ORACULAR
The mobile/web application for scanning NFC tags and verifying product authenticity.

---

## P

### PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography)
Cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum computer attacks. TAG IT is preparing for PQC integration (Kyber, Dilithium).

---

## Q

### Quarantine
A time-locked period (default 48 hours) after an asset is flagged, during which transfers are blocked pending investigation.

---

## R

### Recycle
The lifecycle function that decommissions an asset at end-of-life. Transitions to terminal RECYCLED state.

### Resolve
The lifecycle function that closes a dispute, either returning the asset to its owner, transferring to a claimant, or recycling.

### RWA (Real World Asset)
Physical assets tokenized on blockchain. TAG IT specializes in RWA authentication via NFC-bound Digital Twins.

---

## S

### SIGMA BOY
TAG IT's future custom NFC chip with PQC cryptography, extreme temperature tolerance, and radiation hardening for defense/space applications.

### Soulbound
A token that cannot be transferred after minting. Used for Identity Badges to permanently link identity to an address.

### SUN (Secure Unique NFC)
NXP's authentication protocol for NTAG 424 DNA chips. Generates unique CMAC signatures proving physical tag presence.

---

## T

### TAGIT Token
The ERC-20 utility token powering the TAG IT Network. Used for fees, staking, governance, and access.

### Tag Hash
The keccak256 hash of an NFC tag's UID and secret key, stored on-chain to verify tag authenticity without exposing secrets.

### TagTamper
An NTAG 424 DNA variant with physical tamper detection. The chip detects if the tag has been removed or modified.

### Timelock
A mandatory delay between proposal passage and execution. Allows stakeholders to prepare for changes or exit if needed.

---

## U

### UID (Unique Identifier)
The 7-byte hardware identifier burned into each NFC chip at manufacturing. Read-only and globally unique.

---

## V

### Verify
The function that checks asset authenticity using 5+ signals: tag match, owner check, valid state, context, and AI score.

### Vesting
Time-locked token distribution for team, advisors, and investors. Standard schedule: 4-year vest with 1-year cliff.

---

## W

### Weighted Voting
Governance mechanism where vote power depends on house membership weights, not just token holdings.

---

## Z

### ZK (Zero-Knowledge)
Cryptographic proofs that verify information without revealing underlying data. Future TAG IT feature for privacy-preserving verification.
